A whatsapp bot designed for the Kings Of Logic clan for group utilities, member and tournament management and more.
Made with passion and love for the game and coding.

# Features
- Full Command System Discord-Like with "!" as default prefix
- Group Management
- Full roles and permissions system
- Tournament Management
  - Creation
  - Deletion
  - Registration
  - Subscriptions
  - Match Planning
  - Match Management
- Member Management

# Why?
I've made other bots-like for telegram and discord but I haven't seen any
open framework or tools to make whatsapp bots properly, thanks to facebook to make difficult it's
bot making community without any open source tools and pay walls for business only.
So i wanted to make a whattsapp full customizable and useful open source bot for whatsapp as a bet and challenge (for fun);

# Tools used
- Baileys Library 
- NodeJS
  - tsx (The best typescript runner out there at the time writing this README)
- And primarily Typescript
- Jest (Testing)


# Acknowledgments
